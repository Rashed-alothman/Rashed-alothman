🤔 Fun Facts About Me

🔍 I’m always curious about how things work—be it code, gadgets, or the universe. (Still haven’t figured out how socks disappear in the laundry, though.)

🧠 I believe that learning never stops; every project teaches me something new. (Like how to Google “Why isn’t my code working?” 50 different ways.)

🖥️ My first-ever program was a simple “Hello, World!”—now I’m building systems that sometimes say “Error: World Not Found.”

🎮 Gaming taught me problem-solving and patience—debugging is just another boss fight. (Except this boss spawns 10 new bugs every time you hit it.)

🛠️ I love tinkering with DIY tech projects; creating is half the fun. (The other half is wondering why nothing works the first time.)

📚 I enjoy diving into tech blogs and YouTube channels to stay ahead of the curve. (Yes, I’ve watched “How to build a quantum computer”—no, I’m not building one. Yet.)

🌌 Space and technology inspire me; both are limitless frontiers waiting to be explored. (Still waiting for Elon Musk to DM me about that Mars trip.)

💻 My Toolkit

Here’s what I’m working with:

Languages: Python, Java, C++, JS

Frameworks & Tools: TensorFlow, Flask, Docker, Git, scikit-learn, 

Hobbies: Gaming, problem-solving, and creating futuristic tech.

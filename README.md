### Development Projects

#### **Docker and Tailscale Infrastructure Setup**
Built a complete containerized infrastructure with secure remote access using Docker and Tailscale. This project demonstrates practical DevOps skills including container orchestration, networking, and secure service deployment. The setup enables seamless remote access to services through Tailscale's mesh VPN while maintaining security best practices.

Key features:
- Multi-container Docker environment with docker-compose
- Tailscale integration for secure remote access
- Network isolation and service discovery
- Production-ready configuration management

#### **Snatch: Terminal-Based Media Downloader**
Command-line Python application for efficient media downloads with fast download management and a user-friendly interface.

Note: Project is mostly complete, but I wish I had focused on something more impactful.
